speculative is a collection of specs for the functions in `clojure.core`. While
its ultimate goal is to be rendered obsolete by these or similar specs being
added to `clojure.core` proper, speculative hopefully provides some value while
we're waiting for that to happen.

## Rationale

With the new error-messages that are coming with Clojure 1.10, adding specs to
the `clojure.core` functions give much better error messages.

Without specs on `clojure.core/map` the error looks like:

```clojure
Clojure 1.10.0-RC1
user=> (map 'lol 'lol)
Error printing return value (IllegalArgumentException) at clojure.lang.RT.seqFrom (RT.java:551).
Don't know how to create ISeq from: clojure.lang.Symbol
user=>
```
With speculative, we get 

```
user=> (map 1 'lol)
Evaluation error - invalid arguments to clojure.core/map at (NO_SOURCE_FILE:4).
1 - failed: ifn? at: [:f]
user=>
```

## Installation

Add the relevant coordinates to your favourite build tool:

deps.edn

```
speculative {:mvn/version "0.0.2"}
```

lein

```
[speculative "0.0.2"]
```

## Usage

```clojure
user=> (require 'speculative.core)
nil
user=> (require '[clojure.spec.test.alpha :as stest])
nil
user=> (stest/instrument `map)
[clojure.core/map]
user=> (map 1 'lol)
Evaluation error - invalid arguments to clojure.core/map at (NO_SOURCE_FILE:4).
1 - failed: ifn? at: [:f]
user=>

```

## Test tools

Namespace `speculative.test` provides various tools around
`clojure.spec.test.alpha`. More info [here](doc/test.md).

## Origins

The project started based on two tweets. First @mfikes tweeted

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I still
hold the view that Clojure’s core fns should have specs. <br><br>Ex: While<br>
(merge-with + [0 3] {0 7 1 2} {0 3 2 32})<br>produces a reasonable result, it is
not even a map. A spec would reject 2nd arg.<br><br>What if I conclude dot
products are possible via<br> (merge-with + [0 3] [1 2])<br>?</p>&mdash; Mike

Then @borkdude tweeted a couple of days later: <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"
data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Or maybe have a
development version with guards and a production version without guards (I think
Stu said something like this)</p>&mdash; (λ. borkdude) (@borkdude) <a

## Contributing

In the hope that the code in this project would be useful for `clojure.core`,
any contributer to this repo needs to have a [Contributor
Agreement](https://clojure.org/community/contributing) for Clojure so that any
code in speculative can be used in either Clojure or Clojurescript.

Please have look at the [style guide](doc/style.md) before submitting a PR.
